- `src/utils`: Helpers (animations, media utils, assets mapping)
- `src/index.css`: Global styles (Tailwind utilities + custom CSS)
- `src/main.jsx`: App bootstrap and optional Sentry init
- `public/models`: GLB models and public assets


## Screens & Highlights
- Hero with video
- Highlights with animated title and links
- Custom GSAP-driven video carousel with progress indicators
- 3D iPhone viewer with color/size controls
- Features section with images/video and scroll animations

## Getting Started
1) Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- npm (or pnpm/yarn)

2) Clone & install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/apple-project.git
cd apple-project
npm install
```

3) Start dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open the printed URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

Want a fixed port (e.g., 5100)? Add this to `vite.config.js`:
```js
export default defineConfig({
  server: { port: 5100 },
  plugins: [react()]
})
```

4) Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```
Artifacts will be generated in the `dist/` folder.

5) Preview the build
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Scripts
- `dev`: start Vite dev server
- `build`: build production bundle
- `preview`: preview the production build locally

## Optional Configuration
- Sentry: The project includes Sentry integration. Update the `dsn` in `src/main.jsx` if you want error/perf monitoring.
- 3D Assets: GLB models live in `public/models/`. Replace assets as needed and adjust camera/scale in `ModelView.jsx`.
- Tailwind: Mix utility classes in JSX with fineâ€‘grained styles in `src/index.css`.
